# Mobile-Robotics
* This repo include a curated list of material which is useful for designing system architectures,
algorithms, and software for autonomous aerial and ground mobile robots.
* Especially focus on Perception, Motion Control, and Data Analytics.
* Also stay tuned for more update on reinforment learning algorithm applied on robotics.

## Intro: 
* An idea future: better work integration of Cyber and Physical components.
* Cyber components include software, embedded computers, sensors, and other 
electronic and computational artifacts
* physical components include hardware (cars, airplanes, power lines) that 
is subject to the rules of physics (dynamics, kinematics, elctromechanics, fluid flows).
